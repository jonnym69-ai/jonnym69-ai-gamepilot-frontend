console.log('🎯 UI/UX COLLISION & FILTER FIXES COMPLETE')
console.log('=' .repeat(50))

console.log('\n✅ ISSUE 1: UI Overlap Fixed')
console.log('   • Before: Library grid overlapped empty state placeholder')
console.log('   • After: Added relative z-10 to library grid container')
console.log('   • Result: Game cards appear above empty states')

console.log('\n✅ ISSUE 2: Mood Sets Standardized')
console.log('   • Before: FindYourPerfectPlay used old MOODS (calming, cozy)')
console.log('   • After: Updated MOODS to match AI-generated moods')
console.log('   • Result: Both components use same canonical list')

console.log('\n✅ ISSUE 3: Genre Filter Enhanced')
console.log('   • Before: Exact matching failed on "action game" vs "action"')
console.log('   • After: Case-insensitive .includes() matching')
console.log('   • Result: Handles suffixes and variations correctly')

console.log('\n✅ ISSUE 4: Launch Button Fixed')
console.log('   • Before: Passed only game.appId (caused Invalid appId errors)')
console.log('   • After: Pass full game object, extract appId in launch function')
console.log('   • Result: GameCard receives complete game data')

console.log('\n🎮 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:')
console.log('   • "Total Games: 0" → "Total Games: 124"')
console.log('   • Mood filtering works with case-insensitive matching')
console.log('   • Genre filtering handles suffixes correctly')
console.log('   • Launch button uses correct appId from database')
console.log('   • UI elements no longer overlap')

console.log('\n🔍 DEBUG OUTPUT TO EXPECT:')
console.log('   • "🔍 Filter Debug - Selected mood: Intense"')
console.log('   • "🔍 All moods in library: ["Intense","Strategic","Challenging"]')
console.log('   • "🎮 Loaded and normalized user games: 124"')
console.log('   • No more "All moods in library: [\'chill\']"')

console.log('\n🚀 READY FOR TESTING!')
console.log('   • Refresh browser to see mood standardization')
console.log('   • Test mood filtering - should work correctly')
console.log('   • Test genre filtering - should handle suffixes')
console.log('   • Test launch button - should use correct appId')
console.log('   • Check UI - no overlapping elements')
